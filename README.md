DNS ENSEMBLE LIBRARY REPOSITORY

This repository provides a complete set of functions for the simulation of single DNSs ( Couette and Poiseuille) 
and ensemble DNSs of the same flow. Additional diagnostic scripts that perform the optimal and modal stability 
analysis on streamwise-mean base flows are also included. A stochastic forcing is now availabe to assist with 
the deviation of flow realizations and relevant experiments.

The DNS settings are identical to the single flow case. Ensemble parameters have been added to stipulate the number 
of ensemble members.
