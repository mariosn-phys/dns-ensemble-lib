DNS ENSEMBLE LIBRARY REPOSITORY

This repository provides a complete set of functions for the simulation of single DNSs ( Couette and Poiseuille) 
and ensemble DNSs of the same flow. Additional diagnostic scripts that perform the optimal and modal stability 
analysis on streamwise-mean base flows are also included. A stochastic forcing is now availabe to assist with 
the deviation of flow realizations and the transition experiments.

The DNS settings are identical to the single flow case (refer to dns-matlab-gpu). Ensemble parameters have been 
added to dictate the number of ensemble members.
