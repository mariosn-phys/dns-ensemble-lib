DNS ENSEMBLE LIBRARY REPOSITORY

This repository provides a complete set of functions for the simulation of single DNSs ( Couette and Poiseuille) 
and ensemble DNSs of the same flow. Additional diagnostic scripts that perform the optimal and modal stability 
analysis on streamwise-mean base flows are also included.
